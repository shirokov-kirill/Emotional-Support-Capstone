## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment instruction

If you want to use a local version of the application, you can deploy our application. 
To deploy the application in Docker containers on a Linux machine with Docker installed, follow these steps:

1. Navigate inside the repository.
2. Execute: `chmod +x deploy.sh`.
3. Run the deploy script: `./deploy.sh`.

The script deploys 3 Docker containers:

- **Web app with Nginx**: The Nginx serves the web app requests and proxies API requests sent to `/api` to the backend container.
- **Backend**: The backend processes data and interacts with the database.
- **DB**: The database container that stores all app-related data.

**Recommended minimal configuration for the Linux machine**:  
2 Cores and 4 GB RAM.
